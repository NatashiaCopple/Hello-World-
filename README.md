# Hello-World-
My first repository
My name is Natashia, and I am new to coding.  I could code all day, so I've decided to make a career out of it.  I'm grateful for opportunity to go to school in southern California.  It is so beautiful here.  Next, I hope to attend UC Davis to complete an undergraduate degree in ... Computer science. I am not sure exactly what I want to be the best at yet, but I am leaning towards machine learning.
